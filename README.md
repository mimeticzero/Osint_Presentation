### 🇨🇳 China-related scams & e-commerce frauds 

⏱️ Delivery: 2–4 days

🔎 I specialize in investigating scams and false identities linked to China-based platforms.

Common use cases:
- You’ve placed an order on a Chinese website (AliExpress, DHgate, private seller…) and never received it
- You’ve been contacted by a fake supplier or dropshipping partner (Alibaba, Wechat)
- You need to verify a seller or check if a Chinese company really exists

What I can do:
- Deep company lookup in Chinese business databases (QCC, Tianyancha…)
- Verification of WeChat/QQ/Weibo presence
- Domain WHOIS + archive & hosting analysis (ICP license etc.)
- Link analysis between product, site, and shipping sources
- PDF report (EN/FR) with screenshot-based findings

> Bonus: I lived in China, speak basic Chinese, and use native Chinese platforms (Wechat, QQ, Weibo) through a valid number.
